# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Dart.

## How to Play

1. Run the Dart program.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying a number between 1 and 9, which corresponds to the position on the board.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells on the board are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Supports two players (Player 1 and Player 2).
- Prints the current state of the board after each move.
- Checks for a win after each move and declares the winner.
- Ends the game in a draw if all cells on the board are filled without any player winning.

## How to Run

To run the game:

1. Make sure you have Dart installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Dart file (`tictactoe.dart`).
4. Run the Dart file using the Dart VM.

```
dart tictactoe.dart
```
